# Journal Project

A brief description of what this project does and who it's for


## Installation

Install my-project with npm

```bash
  cd client
  cd journal
  npm install
  npm run dev

  Open a new terminal
  cd server 
  npm install
  npm run dev
```

## Challenges

Some challenges I went through were with editing the journal and persisting it. 
Another was data persisting in the wrong format when it was deleted then a new journal was added, and I fixed that by adding a line break in the beginning of the new journals being added.
